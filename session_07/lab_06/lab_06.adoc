= Lab 6 - Using PCF Autoscaler CLI

== App Autoscaler Overview
App Autoscaler is a marketplace service that helps control the cost of running apps while maintaining app performance.
The App Autoscaler automatically scales Cloud Foundry apps in response to demand. The App Autoscaler CLI lets you control the App Autoscaler from your local command line by extending the Cloud Foundry command-line interface (cf CLI).

To balance app performance and cost, Space Developers can use App Autoscaler to do the following:

* Configure rules that adjust instance counts based on metrics thresholds such as CPU Usage
* Modify the maximum and minimum number of instances for an app, either manually or following a schedule

link:https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler-cli.html[Using the App Autoscaler CLI] documentation is the location for detailed information on the PCF 2.1 Autoscaler CLI.

=== Configure Autoscaling for an App
App Autoscaler keeps instance counts within an allowable range defined by minimum and maximum values, or instance limits.

Follow the procedures in the sections below to set any of the following:

* Instance Limits
* Scaling Rules
* Scheduled Limit Changes

== Enable autoscaling for an app

To enable autoscaling, an instance of the _App Autoscaler_ must be created and bound to the app. At that point the CLI can be use to enable or disable autoscaling. Note that one, and only one, _App Autoscaler_ service can exist within a space.

To create an instance of the _App Autoscaler_ and bind it to the `attendees` app, open link:https://run.pivotal.io[PWS] in a browser, go to your assigned org and space where the `attendees` is running, and flip the *Autoscaling* switch.

image::/../../common/images/AppsMan-autoscaler.png[]

This creates the service and binds it to the app. In 30 seconds or so, the app will autoscale to two instances due to the default being 2 min and 3 max.

At this point, autoscaling is enabled. To disable autoscaling without unbinding or deleting the autoscaler service, use the `cf disable-autoscaling attendees` CLI. To re-enable autoscaling, simply run `cf enable-autoscaling attendees`.

== Update autoscaling limits

Limits define the minimum and maximum application instances (AI's) which will run according to the rules provided. If no rules are provided, then the minimum number of AI's will be achieved.

Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) users with the _Space Developer_ role can set up and configure the _App Autoscaler_ service in the _Apps Manager UI_ or the `cf` CLI to automatically scale apps based on link:https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html#metric[rules]. 

*NOTE*: Space Managers, Space Auditors, and all Org roles do not have permission to use _App Autoscaler_.

Use the following `cf` CLI _Auto Scaling_ command to change the minimum and maximum settings.

----
$ cf update-autoscaling-limits attendees 1 8
Updated autoscaling instance limits for app attendees for org STLWorkshop / space instructor as cbusch@pivotal.io
OK
----

== Create autoscaling rules

To keep your apps available without wasting resources, _App Autoscaler_ increments or decrements instance counts based on how current metrics compare with configurable High and Low thresholds.

**How App Autoscaler Determines When to Scale**

App Autoscaler scales apps as follows:

* Increment by one instance when any metric exceeds the High threshold specified
* Decrement by one instance only when all metrics fall below the Low threshold specified

The following command creates an `http_throughput` rule which watches the "Total HTTP Requests" per second (divided by total app instances).

----
$ cf create-autoscaling-rule attendees http_throughput 24 25
----

This rule looks for the average CPU percentage for all instances of the app.

----
$ cf create-autoscaling-rule attendees cpu 89 90
----

== Using an autoscaling manifest

A manifest YAML file can be created to capture auto scaling limits and rules to make it easy to apply in CI/CD pipelines during normal deployments.

Examples `autoscaler_manifest.yml`:

----
instance_limits:
  min: 1
  max: 8
rules:
  - rule_type: "http_latency"
    rule_sub_type: "avg_95th"
    threshold:
      min: 199
      max: 200
scheduled_limit_changes:
  - recurrence: 10
    executes_at: "2018-04-03T15:10:55Z"
    instance_limits:
      min: 10
      max: 20
----

Applying limits and rules with a manifest file:

----
$ cf configure-autoscaling attendees autoscaler_manifest.yml
----

== Viewing the rules
At any time, you can use the following command to see what auto scaling rules have been applied to an application.

----
$ cf autoscaling-rules attendees
----

== Deleting rules
Using the output of the `cf autoscaling-rule <app>` viewing, copy the _Rule Guid_ to use in the delete a rule, as demonstrated below:

----
$ cf delete-autoscaling-rule attendees <RULE GUID>
----

View the app rules to verify that the rule has been deleted.

----
$ cf autoscaling-rules attendees
----

== Autoscaling events
App Autoscaler logs all autoscaling events including scaling decisions and binding auto-disable events.

To view all autoscaling events in the past 24 hours, click the view more icon in the Event History section of the App Autoscaler UI.

----
$ cf autoscaling-events attendees
----

Creat new rules to make events fire, such as:

----
$ cf create-autoscaling-rule attendees http_throughput 10 20
----

Show the events occuring. 

*Note* that the _App Autoscaler_ is set for the entire PCF installation and usually is configured to occur every 30 seconds, or so, but could be as much as 3 minutes.

----
$ cf autoscaling-events attendees
----

== Stop autoscaling for an app
To disable autoscaling for an app, use the following command. This does not delete the _App Autoscaler_ service instance or unbind the service from your app. It simply disables its use. At any time the `cf enable-autoscaling <app>` can be used to re-enable auto scaling.

----
$ cf disable-autoscaling attendees
----
